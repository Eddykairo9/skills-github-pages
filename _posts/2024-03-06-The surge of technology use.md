The surge of technology use is a major trend that's been around for a while, but it's definitely accelerated in recent years. There are a few reasons for this:

The COVID-19 pandemic: Lockdowns and social distancing measures forced people to rely more on technology for work, education, and socializing. This led to a boom in tools like video conferencing, remote work platforms, and e-learning [2].

Advancements in technology:  Gadgets are constantly getting more powerful, affordable, and user-friendly. This makes it easier for people to integrate technology into their lives [1]. For example, artificial intelligence is making search engines more helpful and voice assistants like Siri and Alexa are changing the way we interact with devices [6].

Improved internet access:  Broadband internet is becoming more widely available, especially with the rise of mobile data. This means people can stay connected no matter where they are [2].
